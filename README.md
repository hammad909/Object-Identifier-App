Object Detection App (Android | CameraX + TensorFlow Lite)
An Android application that uses CameraX and TensorFlow Lite for real-time object detection through the device's camera. Built with Jetpack Compose and MVVM architecture, the app integrates a pre-trained TFLite model to detect and label objects live on screen with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
